# What is this website?
1. This is a Korean restaurant menu that is responsive for both desktop and mobile layouts in which I managed to implement CSS, JavaScript, and HTML. The website includes 6 different pages which are linked to the food images placed on the wooden table. At the bottom of the page, I placed images of food items that are common to classic korean traditional cuisine. Each of these images, when clicked, will display an alert which describes common facts about the respective food, and its origin.

# What Struggles did I face?
1. The biggest struggle I faced was using flexbox and making the webpage responsive. At first I brute forced the margins and widths to make it fit well in a desktop layout. This proved to backfire, because the webpage would break when resized to a smaller width and height. 

# What did I get out of this project?
1. My understanding of flexbox is much stronger and I am sure that next time I create a similar website it will take half as long.
